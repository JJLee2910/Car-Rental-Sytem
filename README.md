# Car-Rental-Sytem
1. Assignment assigned from university. Developed a GUI system for the both admin &amp; customers to manage booking and also booking. System is build using Java Swing and data are all stored in text file.
2. It is a rental system that are accessible by customers and admin.
3. Several assumptions was made while developing the rental system:
  - all admins share the same account to access the systems
  - payment are made via physical methods.
  - users are assumed to return the car on the rental date itself.
  - booking cancellation and delete is unable, users are request to cancel booking via contacting the admin.
4. The entire system is developed using the major 4 OOP concepts.
5. To run the system, run the Application.java under the main folder in src.

# Further Improvements
1. Develope a register page for admin to register.
2. Build a payment gateway/top-up system for the customers.
3. Implement the cancel booking features for the customer and admin.
4. Develop a return car features for the customer & admin to validate if the car is returned or not.
5. Develop an Analytical Dashboard for the admin.
6. Please feel free to think of more improvements of the current system.
